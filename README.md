# Using CoD Maya Tools
## Exporting Models
![ExportXMODEL](http://i.imgur.com/aW0gTZL.png)

To export models to Call of Duty:

1) Set the file path in the export window for where you want the model to be saved to.

2) Select Meshes/Joints (At least one mesh or joint must be selected.)

3) Click "Export Selected".

If you are exporting a model to be used as an animation model, you only need to select the joints. However for APE/Asset Manager to convert the file to an xmodel for use in-game, it must have meshes.

If you have ExportX/Export2Bin's directory set and enabled, then it will be converted to XMODEL_BIN automatically for use in Black Ops 3.

## Exporting Animations

To add notetracks you simply click "Add Note" and enter the name of the notetrack, CoD Maya Tools will automaticly set the frame of the notetrack to the selected frame in the timeline, however you can edit at any time in the export window.

If you have imported a SEAnim or alike with notetracks, then you can click "Grab Notes" and it will automatically grab the notes.

To export an animation reveresed, simply select the option to export the anim reveresed. 

If you have ExportX/Export2Bin's directory set and enabled, then it will be converted to XANIM_BIN automatically for use in Black Ops 3.

## Ray's Anim Toolkit

To use Ray's Anim Toolkit:

1) Select tag_camera and go to Call of Duty Tools>Ray's Camera Animation Toolkit and select "Mark as Camera".

2) Select tag_weapon/tag_weapon_right and in the same menu click "Mark as Weapon".

3) Click "Generate Camera Animation".

3) Click "Export Selected".

## Cosmetic Bones:

In Black Ops 3 we have now have "cosmetic bones", these are usually bones that define face features or small cosmetic features on the model. If you're porting from Black Ops 3, cosmetic joints are usually obvious, as they are a large number of joints with no children parented to 1 joint, for character models for example, this is the joint "head".

All cosmetic bones share the same parent, and thus it is easier to mark 1 joint as the parent and everything under that joint be cosmetic, to do this:

1) Select the parent of the cosmetic bones.

2) In the export window select "Set selected as Cosmetic Parent", CoD Maya Tools will tell you it's been marked.

3) Export as normal.

Cosmetic Bones cannot have children and there can only be 1 cosmetic parent.

### For cosmetic models they MUST be converted using ExportX (which is recommended over Export2Bin), to download ExportX, click here:
